# (No Show Appointment)
## by (EGBEAHIE, WHITNEY EHILUONAMHEN)

## Investigate a dataset is the first project in UDACITY nanodegree. I worked on the no show appointment dataset. The dataset includes some ailments that patients had. It shows patient that showed and didn't shpw up for thier medical appointment. In other to aide My analysis the following questions were asked:

How many persons who had medical conditions, are a recipients of government scholarship, received sms 
text kept to their appointment? 
What is the number of persons that are recipients of government scholarship, and have been diagnosed 
with heath issues that also received an sms reminder of their appointments? 
whatGender is the highest beneficiary of schoarship, and also has medical conditions which received an 
sms text? 
Those who were on government scholarship that received sms reminder of their appointments. 
To be able to provide the right-visual-answer to eachof the above questions,  had to use the GROUPBY function. 
This enabled me to appropriately categorize my above questions and answer them accordingly.


### TOOLS
Python, libaries: pandas, numpy, pandas, matplotlib
Jupyter notebook


### CONCLUSION:
I realized that there were not many government scholarship given out, perhaps it affected the attendance
of people to show up for the appointment. It might have been expensive. Theymight actually have booked 
for appointment but didnâ€™t show up because it was not affordable for them.
